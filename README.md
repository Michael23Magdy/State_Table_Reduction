# Sequential Logic Circuit State Table Reducer

## Description
This Java application is designed to reduce the State table of a sequential logic circuit by eliminating redundant states and network using the <mark>implication table technique</mark> . By reducing the number of states, the application aims to minimize the number of flip-flops required and thus reduce the overall cost of the circuit. It provides a friendly console UI with colored output and easy input capabilities.

## Features
- User-friendly console UI with colored output
- Reduces State table by eliminating redundant states
- Provides implication table for analysis
- Outputs the reduced table and groups states together

## Installation
To use this application, you'll need Java installed on your system. You can download and install Java from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. navigate in your cmd to the project folder.
2. Compile the Java source files using the following command:
    javac Main.java
2. run the Java source files using the following command:
    java Main.java


## Usage
1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to input the State table of your sequential logic circuit.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the State table details.
3. The program will process the input and provide the reduced table along with the states grouped together.
4. Analyze the implication table generated to understand the reduction process.
